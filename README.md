Overview
The website was built and is maintained by our team using WordPress. We communicate through WeChat and use GitHub to upload our projects. Trello is used for project management.

Theme Development
We used Elementor for the website's design, which allows for visual editing and a drag-and-drop interface. The Champion School Texas theme was used as a starting point and customized according to our needs.

Hosting and Deployment
We are using a free domain and hosting service provider called InfinityFree, which offers unlimited storage and traffic and supports technologies such as PHP and MySQL. We are responsible for managing and maintaining the website ourselves.

Content Management
We regularly update the website's content, including creating new pages or posts, managing events through the Events Calendar plugin, and categorizing content using WordPress' built-in categories and tags features.

Update Method
We regularly check for updates to WordPress and its plugins and update as soon as possible to ensure the website remains secure and stable. We test updates in a staging environment before deploying them to the live website.

It is completed by students at James Cook University, Group G of Class CP3402, year 2023. Work on this project was performed by a small group of international students over the course of the study period and is intended as a culmination of our learning for this semester.
