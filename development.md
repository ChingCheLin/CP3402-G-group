Deployment Overview
The name of our page is Baizonn Learning Center. We use wordpress to build web pages.
Team members are constantly on the webpage design and change according to the requirements.

Applications and Processes
We use wechat for homework communication, and share some webpage making skills, 
as well as ideas and opinions on webpage design. We use github to upload our projects.

Theme Development
We developed in wordpress using The champion school texas. 
Our page is simple. We've added a logo, a menu bar, various images and text, and links to youtube videos. 
The footer places the contact information.

Hosting and Deployment
We chose a free domain name and hosting service provider called infinity free.
which offers free domain name and hosting services including unlimited storage and traffic, 
support for technologies such as PHP and MySQL, suitable for individual or small websites. 
We are required to manage and maintain the website ourselves. And we used elementor to build the site.

Project Management
We have Trello to track and manage our projects. We planned three parts to track the project. 
The first part is that our group leader assigns tasks to us.
The second part is that we finish the work we need and discuss and improve our design.
The third is the work already done. The purpose of Trello is to help us document the project as a whole.
